# Supply-Chain-Analytics-Inventory-Optimization-for-MediCrystals-Co.

Project Overview

This project focuses on inventory optimization, supplier risk assessment, and demand forecasting for MediCrystals Co., a multinational pharmaceutical glass manufacturer. The goal was to enhance supply chain efficiency, reduce costs, and mitigate supplier risks through data-driven insights and strategic decision-making.

The project involved data retrieval, inventory analysis, risk scoring, and dashboard development, aligning closely with supply chain management and data analytics best practices. SQL, Excel, and Tableau were utilized to conduct the analysis, optimize inventory policies, and visualize key trends.

Problem Statement

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains, causing severe constraints in raw material availability, supplier operations, and inventory management. MediCrystals, a key manufacturer of pharmaceutical glass containers (vials, ampoules, syringes), faced the following critical challenges:
	•	Unprecedented demand surges for vaccine-related glass packaging.
	•	Supply chain bottlenecks due to pandemic-driven disruptions in logistics and raw material sourcing.
	•	High supplier risks resulting from financial instability, labor shortages, and regulatory compliance issues.
	•	Inventory mismanagement, leading to both stockouts and obsolete inventory accumulation.

 Key Objectives & Methodology

1. Inventory Position & Obsolete Stock Analysis
	•	Retrieved and analyzed on-hand inventory levels using SQL queries & Excel calculations.
	•	Assessed working capital impacts of fluctuating inventory demands.
	•	Identified obsolete stock trends, preventing unnecessary holding costs.

2. Safety Stock & Reorder Point Optimization
	•	Conducted lead time demand variability analysis to determine optimal safety stock levels.
	•	Implemented Reorder Point (ROP) calculations to reduce stockouts and ensure a 98% service level.
	•	Used historical demand data to forecast future replenishment needs.

3. Supplier Risk Scoring & Procurement Analysis
	•	Designed a supplier risk assessment model incorporating:
	•	Financial stability (credit ratings, cash flow health).
	•	Regulatory compliance (labor unrest, environmental violations).
	•	Operational reliability (historical lead time delays, supply chain disruptions).
	•	Created a weighted scoring system to classify suppliers into low, medium, and high-risk categories.
	•	Recommended strategic sourcing adjustments to mitigate procurement risks.

4. Data Visualization & Reporting
	•	Developed interactive dashboards in Tableau to track:
	•	Inventory levels & reorder points.
	•	Supplier performance & risk metrics.
	•	Demand forecasting trends.
	•	Automated data retrieval & reporting workflows, reducing manual intervention.

Technologies & Tools Used
	•	Excel (Pivot Tables, VLOOKUP, Index-Match, Array Formulas): Data analysis & inventory calculations.
	•	Tableau: Visualization of supply chain KPIs & trends.
	•	Statistical Modeling: Demand forecasting, safety stock, and supplier risk scoring.
